# Austin Bikeshare data on Google BigQuery 

## Purpose and scope 

The idea behind this project was to demonstrate Google's BQ API in a Python environment. I used publicly available data from the Austin bikeshare system as a sample dataset. 

The project is documented in the Jupyter notebook included in this repo.
